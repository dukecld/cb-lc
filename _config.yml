description: "The Grinnell College Physics Museum consists primarily of instruments and equipment used to teach physics or do physics research at Grinnell College.  The core of the collection are objects purchased or constructed from approximately 1882 to 1970.  In addition, the museum includes donated physics-related equipment, such as telephone and telegraph instruments and x-ray equipment.  It also includes an excellent collection of meteorites which the college obtained as payment for tuition. Approximately half of the collection is on display in the Noyce Science Center at Grinnell College"
